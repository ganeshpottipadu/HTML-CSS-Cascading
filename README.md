# HTML-CSS-Cascading
CSS cascading prioritizes styles by specificity, order, and inheritance. This HTML/CSS code builds nested boxes. A `.bigbox` with a violet border contains blue `.box` elements, each holding red `.innerbox` elements. Paragraph text starts yellow but is overridden to white due to cascading. Padding and borders add spacing.
